There are at the moment in this team, oh, some players forget them pro what they are. I do not read very many newspapers, but I have heard many situations. First, we did not play offensively. There is no German team plays offensively and the name offensively like Bayern. Last game we had in place three tops: Elber, Jancka and then Zickler. We must not forget Zickler. Zickler is one more tops, Mehmet anyway more Basler. Is clear these words, is possible understand what I said? Thank you. Offensive, offensive is how we make in space. Secondly: I have explained with these two players: after Dortmund may need half-time break. I have also seen other teams in Europe after this Wednesday. I have also seen two days training. A coach is not an idiot! A coach should see what happen in place. In this game there were two, three of these players were weak as a bottle empty! Have you seen Wednesday, which team has played Wednesday? Has played Mehmet or played Basler or has played Trapattoni? These players complain more than they play! Do you know why the Italy teams do not buy these players? Because we have seen many times such game! Have
